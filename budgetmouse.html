				In my opinion, the best mouse for people on a tight budget is the HyperX Pulsefire FPS for a price 
				of $40. This mouse is rated for 50 million clicks which will last 10 years on average. Assuming you don't 
				led lighting which makes it a bit better looking. It has an ergonomic form wihch makes it a little bit more
				break it before then, you will have plenty of time to save up money for a better mouse. This mouse has red 
				comfortabsle to use. It also includes a DPI switch that goes up to 3200 DPI but we all know you will only
				use 400 or 800.
