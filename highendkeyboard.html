				In my opinion, the best keyboard for people that have a budget of $100+ is the Razer Huntsman Tournament Edition for a price of $180.
				The Razer Huntsman TE uses Razer's own red optical switches and are rated for 100 million key presses
				which is the highest in the industry. It has full RGB lighting so you can show off all your cool colour patterns. This keyboard
				used doubleHarder and more durable than ABS or PVC, PBT is a thermoplastic that gives the keycaps their premium feel and qualityâ€”a tough, 
				textured finish that holds up well against intense use. This keyboard uses an 80% tenkeyless layout which gets rid of the useless numpad
				saving you valuable desk space.
