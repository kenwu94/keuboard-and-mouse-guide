				<p class="paragraph">	
				In my opinion, the best keyboard for people on a tight budget is the Corsair K55 for a price of $50. 
				This keyboard uses membrane keyswitches which will last a long enough time for you to get enough money to 
				buy a better keyboard. This keyboard has RGB so you can still flex it to your friends. <br>

			<h2 class="headers">Budget Mouse</h2>
				<p class="paragraph">	
				In my opinion, the best mouse for people on a tight budget is the HyperX Pulsefire FPS for a price 
				of $40. This mouse is rated for 50 million clicks which will last 10 years on average. Assuming you don't 
				led lighting which makes it a bit better looking. It has an ergonomic form wihch makes it a little bit more
				break it before then, you will have plenty of time to save up money for a better mouse. This mouse has red 
				comfortabsle to use. It also includes a DPI switch that goes up to 3200 DPI but we all know you will only
				use 400 or 800.

			<h2 class="headers">Mid-Tier Keyboard</h2>
				<p style="font-family: times new roman; font-size: 18px;">
				In my opinion, the best keyboard for people that have a decent budget of $70-$100 is the HyperX Alloy FPS Pro.
				This keyboard uses Cherry MX Red key switches which will provide a smooth, linear feel when the key is pressed.
				Each key on this keyboard is rated for 10 million key presses which will last 10-15 years under regular usage. 
				This keyboard has red LED lighting so you can show it off to your friends. The frame of this keyboard is made 
				out of solid steel so if you drop it, you should be fine. This keyboard uses a 80% tenkeyless layout because who 
				even uses the numpad anyways?

			<h2 class="headers">Mid-Tier Mouse</h2>
				<p class="paragraph">
				In my opinion, the best mouse for people that have a budget of $70-$100 is the Razer Deathadder Elite
				for a price of $90. This mouse is rated for 50 million clicks and can go up to 16000DPI but no one uses 
				that high DPI. It can track at 450 inches per second which is just about as hard as you can move your mouse 
				physically. Razer boasts the Deathadder Elite's 99.4% accuracy which is among the highest of all mice. 
				It also includes 2 thumb mouse buttons that can be programmed using Razer Synapse. The Deathadder Elite 
				weights 120g. Overall, this is an amazing mouse that may even outperform more expensive mice.

			<h2 class="headers">High-End Keyboard</h2>
				<p class="paragraph">
				In my opinion, the best keyboard for people that have a budget of $100+ is the Razer Huntsman Tournament Edition for a price of $180.
				The Razer Huntsman TE uses Razer's own red optical switches and are rated for 100 million key presses
				which is the highest in the industry. It has full RGB lighting so you can show off all your cool colour patterns. This keyboard
				used doubleHarder and more durable than ABS or PVC, PBT is a thermoplastic that gives the keycaps their premium feel and quality—a tough, 
				textured finish that holds up well against intense use. This keyboard uses an 80% tenkeyless layout which gets rid of the useless numpad
				saving you valuable desk space.

			<h2 class="headers">High-End Mouse</h2>
				<p class="paragraph">
				In my opinion, the best mouse for people that have a budget of $100+ is the Razer Viper for a price of $110. This mouse features 
				Razer's optical switches. Razer's optical switches work by having a laser shining on the switch and when you click, the laser shines
				through the switch. The Razer optical switches features an industry leading 0.2 millisecond actuation time. Its instant actuation 
				eliminates debounce and unintended clicks. Like the Deathadder Elite, the Razer Viper has a tracking accuracy of 99.4% which is the 
				highest of all mice. Plus, it also has a maximum DPI of 16000DPI. The Razer Viper weighs in at just 69g without any compromise on 
				its build strength. A lighter mouse allows swifter, more controlled swipes. The mouse switch is rated for 70 million clicks which will 
				last about 15 years under regular use.
