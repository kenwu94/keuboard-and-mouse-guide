				<p style="font-family: times new roman; font-size: 18px;">
				In my opinion, the best keyboard for people that have a decent budget of $70-$100 is the HyperX Alloy FPS Pro.
				This keyboard uses Cherry MX Red key switches which will provide a smooth, linear feel when the key is pressed.
				Each key on this keyboard is rated for 10 million key presses which will last 10-15 years under regular usage. 
				This keyboard has red LED lighting so you can show it off to your friends. The frame of this keyboard is made 
				out of solid steel so if you drop it, you should be fine. This keyboard uses a 80% tenkeyless layout because who 
				even uses the numpad anyways?
				<br><br><i>Here is a link to where you can buy this keyboard: <a href = "https://www.amazon.ca/HyperX-Tenkeyless-Mechanical-HX-KB4RD1-US-R1/dp/B074F5L8GQ">HyperX Alloy FPS Pro</a>
