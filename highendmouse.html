				In my opinion, the best mouse for people that have a budget of $100+ is the Razer Viper for a price of $110. This mouse features 
				Razer's optical switches. Razer's optical switches work by having a laser shining on the switch and when you click, the laser shines
				through the switch. The Razer optical switches features an industry leading 0.2 millisecond actuation time. Its instant actuation 
				eliminates debounce and unintended clicks. Like the Deathadder Elite, the Razer Viper has a tracking accuracy of 99.4% which is the 
				highest of all mice. Plus, it also has a maximum DPI of 16000DPI. The Razer Viper weighs in at just 69g without any compromise on 
				its build strength. A lighter mouse allows swifter, more controlled swipes. The mouse switch is rated for 70 million clicks which will 
				last about 15 years under regular use.
