				In my opinion, the best keyboard for people on a tight budget is the Corsair K55 for a price of $50. 
				This keyboard uses membrane keyswitches which will last a long enough time for you to get enough money to 
				buy a better keyboard. This keyboard has RGB so you can still flex it to your friends. <br>
				<br><i>Here is a link to where you can buy this keyboard: <a href = "https://www.amazon.com/CORSAIR-K55-RGB-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B01M4LIKLI"> Corsair K55 </a>
