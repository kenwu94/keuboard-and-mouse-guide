				In my opinion, the best mouse for people that have a budget of $70-$100 is the Razer Deathadder Elite
				for a price of $90. This mouse is rated for 50 million clicks and can go up to 16000DPI but no one uses 
				that high DPI. It can track at 450 inches per second which is just about as hard as you can move your mouse 
				physically. Razer boasts the Deathadder Elite's 99.4% accuracy which is among the highest of all mice. 
				It also includes 2 thumb mouse buttons that can be programmed using Razer Synapse. The Deathadder Elite 
				weights 120g. Overall, this is an amazing mouse that may even outperform more expensive mice.
